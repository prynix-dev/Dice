## 🧠 Project Overview

This project showcases a realistic **3D dice cube** implemented purely with web technologies (HTML & CSS) — without using any JavaScript or heavy libraries. It demonstrates how advanced CSS transforms and transitions can bring depth and interaction to a simple UI.

Each face of the dice is represented by an image, and the cube rotates smoothly in 3D space when hovered.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- 💡 **CSS 3D transforms**
- 🎨 Visual design using CSS
- 🚀 A clean interactive UI
- 📦 A simple, lightweight portfolio piece

## ✨ Features   
- CSS-only 3D cube effect  
- Hover animation for rotation  
- Responsive layout  
- Six sides with distinct images

## 📚 How It Works

The cube consists of six `<div>` faces placed in 3D space using CSS `transform: translateZ()` and `rotateX()` / `rotateY()`.  
Each face has its own positioned image for the number. On container hover, the cube rotates in 3 axes smoothly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
HTML5 — For structure
CSS3 — For styling + 3D transforms
No JavaScript — Pure frontend magic
